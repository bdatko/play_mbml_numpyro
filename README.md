# Model-Based Machine Learning with NumPyro

I enjoy the book [Model-Based Machine Learning](https://mbmlbook.com/index.html), and inspired by [Du Phan's port of Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/fehiepsi/rethinking-numpyro) I decided to port the code to NumPyro.

A lot of help from the Pyro and NumPyro community.
